  The Hedera Mainnet is currently comprised of permissioned consensus nodes
  operated by the Hedera Governing Council

# Node Requirements

The following is provided to help Hedera Governing Council members deploy their permissioned mainnet consensus node. Please note, this information is not intended to apply to Hedera's transition to a permissionless network.

## Minimum Node Requirements

Currently, the Hedera Mainnet will perform at a rate determined by the lowest-performing node. To ensure a common level of performance minimum hardware, connectivity and hosting requirements have been defined for the initial permissioned, Governing Council nodes.

{% hint style="warning" %}
To ensure accurate conformity with the minimum requirements, please provide node hardware, connectivity, and hosting details to Hedera prior to purchase (devops@hedera.com).

{% hint style="info" %}
Reference Configurations available in Appendices B, C, D
{% endhint %}

### Proxy

Access to the node via public APIs must be mediated by an in-line proxy. Below are the specifications for establishing this proxy.

* 2-CPU
* 2GB RAM
* 100GB storage
* 200Mb/S internet network connectivity with public static IP address
* Docker 18 or higher (Hedera to provide Docker image with HAProxy)

### Network Connectivity

Node Connectivity

* 1Gbps internet connectivity – sustained (not burstable)
  * Unmetered preferred
  * Deployed with firewalled access to other mainnet consensus nodes
* Node deployed in dedicated (isolated) DMZ network
  * Static IP (FQDN is not supported)
  * TCP Port 50111 open to 0.0.0.0/0
  * TCP Port 50211 open to 0.0.0.0/0
  * TCP Port 50212 open to 0.0.0.0/0
  * TCP Port 80 open egress to 0.0.0.0/0 (for OS package repository connectivity)
  * TCP Port 443 open egress to 0.0.0.0/0 (for OS package repository connectivity)
  * UDP Port 123 open ingress and egress to 0.0.0.0/0 (for NTP pool synchronization of system time)

Proxy Connectivity

* Static IP address (FQDN not supported)
* 200Mb/s internet connectivity
* TCP Port 80 open egress to 0.0.0.0/0 (for OS package repository connectivity)

### Hosting

* Industry standard hosting requirements for security and availability
  * Tier 1 Data Center Hosting facility
  * SSAE 16 /18, SOC 2 Type 2 compliant
* Hedera will seek to avoid duplicating of hosting providers across Council members

### Software & Installation

  * Red Hat Enterprise
  * Debian
  * BSD not supported
  * CentOS deprecated for 2022

## Deployment Steps

The following steps outline the process for Council Members to add their consensus node to the mainnet.

1. Initial contact with Council Member and node hosting entity
   1. Identify key individuals and project managers
   2. Establish regular deployment team meeting cadence
2. Conveyance of technical requirements and discussion of deployment options
3. Node platform acquisition
   1. Hardware or virtual instance
   2. Network connectivity
   3. Hosting facility
4. Configuration of the operating system on platform
   1. Provisioning of accounts as specified
   2. Provisioning of network access (firewall rules/access control lists)
5. Conveyance of credentials to Hedera
   1. Includes any special instructions for permissioned access such as VPNs
   2. Discussion of support and escalation paths between organizations
6. Hedera undertakes configuration review
   1. Platform
   2. Connectivity
7. Deployment of Hedera consensus node software and required supporting libraries
8. Add connection configuration for a Hedera performance testnet
   1. Hedera executes functional, stability and performance tests for all network services
9. Review of test results and determination of preparedness for mainnet connectivity
   1. Review key management documentation as it relates to Council Member's accounts including: fee account, proxy staking account, et al.
   2. Update private keys using provided tools
10. Schedule mainnet connection
11. Mainnet live
