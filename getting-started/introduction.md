# Introduction

Through this short coding series, you will learn the basics of creating an account, transferring hbar, signing and submitting transactions to the Hedera test network. The Hedera test network allows you to play with our APIs in a non-production environment. You will see how easy it is to get started with one of our Hedera SDKs in the programming language of your choice.

You will need a Hedera testnet account. The Hedera testnet account allows you to interact with our APIs and pay for the transaction fees. To set up a Hedera testnet account, please visit the [Hedera portal](https://portal.hedera.com/register) and follow the instructions. Once you have completed the instructions, you will receive a Hedera testnet account ID (0.0.x) and your private/public key pair on your testnet page. Your Hedera testnet account will also be credited with test hbar upon creation that can only be utilized on the Hedera test network. You will need to copy over your account ID and key pair information when you set up your coding environment in the following steps.

Next, you will set up your coding environment.&#x20;
