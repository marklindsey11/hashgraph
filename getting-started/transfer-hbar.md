**Step 1. Create a transfer transaction**

You should already have a new account from the account you created in the "[Create an account](create-an-account.md)" section. You will transfer 1,000 tinybars from your account to the new account. The account transferring HBAR is required to sign the transaction with the account's corresponding private key to authorize the transfer. Since you are transferring from the account associated with the client, you do not need to explicitly sign the transaction as the operator account signs all transactions to authorize the payment of the transaction fee.

```java
//System.out.println("The new account balance is: " +accountBalance.hbars);
//-----------------------<enter code below>--------------------------------------

//Transfer HBAR
TransactionResponse sendHbar = new TransferTransaction()
     .addHbarTransfer(myAccountId, Hbar.fromTinybars(-1000)) //Sending account
     .addHbarTransfer(newAccountId, Hbar.fromTinybars(1000)) //Receiving account
     .execute(client);
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The net value of the transfer must equal zero (total number of hbars sent by the sender must equal the total number of hbars received by the recipient).
{% endhint %}

**Step 2. Verify the transfer transaction reached consensus**

To verify the transfer transaction reached consensus by the network, you will submit a request to obtain the receipt of the transfer transaction. The receipt will let you know if the transaction was successful or not.

```java
System.out.println("The transfer transaction was: " +sendHbar.getReceipt(client).status);
```

**Step 3. Get the account balance**

**Get the cost of requesting the query**

You can request the cost of a query prior to submitting the query to the Hedera network. Checking an account balance is free of charge today. You can verify that by the method below.

```java
//Request the cost of the query
Hbar queryCost = new AccountBalanceQuery()
     .setAccountId(newAccountId)
     .getCost(client);

System.out.println("The cost of this query is: " +queryCost);
```

**Get the account balance**

You will verify the account balance was updated for the new account by requesting a get account balance query. The current account balance should be the sum of the initial balance (1,000 tinybar) plus the transfer amount (1,000 tinybar) and equal to 2,000 tinybars.

```java
//Check the new account's balance
AccountBalance accountBalanceNew = new AccountBalanceQuery()
     .setAccountId(newAccountId)
     .execute(client);

System.out.println("The new account balance is: " +accountBalanceNew.hbars);
```

**Step 1: Create a transfer transaction**

You should already have a new account ID from the account you created from the "[Create an account](create-an-account.md)" section. You will transfer 1,000 tinybars from your account to the new account. The account sending hbars is the signature that is required for this transaction to be processed.

```javascript
//console.log("The new account balance is: " +accountBalance.hbars.toTinybars() +" tinybar.");
//-----------------------<enter code below>--------------------------------------

//Create the transfer transaction
const sendHbar = await new TransferTransaction()
     .addHbarTransfer(myAccountId, Hbar.fromTinybars(-1000)) //Sending account
     .addHbarTransfer(newAccountId, Hbar.fromTinybars(1000)) //Receiving account
     .execute(client);
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The net value of the transfer must equal zero (total number of hbars sent by the sender must equal the total number of hbars received by the recipient).
{% endhint %}

**Step 2: Verify the transfer transaction reached consensus**

To verify the transfer transaction reached consensus by the network, you will submit a request to obtain the receipt of the transaction. The receipt status will let you know if the transaction was successful (reached consensus) or not.

```javascript
//Verify the transaction reached consensus
const transactionReceipt = await sendHbar.getReceipt(client);
console.log("The transfer transaction from my account to the new account was: " + transactionReceipt.status.toString());
```

**Step 3: Get the updated account balance**

**Get the cost of requesting the query**

You can request the cost of a query prior to submitting the query to the Hedera network. Checking an account balance is free of charge today. You can verify that by the method below.

```javascript
//Request the cost of the query
const queryCost = await new AccountBalanceQuery()
     .setAccountId(newAccountId)
     .getCost(client);

console.log("The cost of query is: " +queryCost);
```

**Get the account balance**

You will verify the account balance was updated for the new account by requesting a get account balance query. The current account balance should be the sum of the initial balance (1,000 tinybars) plus the transfer amount (1,000 tinybasr) and equal to 2,000 tinybars.

```javascript
//Check the new account's balance
const getNewBalance = await new AccountBalanceQuery()
     .setAccountId(newAccountId)
     .execute(client);

console.log("The account balance after the transfer is: " +getNewBalance.hbars.toTinybars() +" tinybar.")
```

**Step 1. Create a transfer transaction**

You should already have a new account ID from the account you created in the "[Create an account](create-an-account.md)" section. You will transfer 1,000 tinybars from your testnet account to the new account. The sender account's private key is required to sign the transaction. The sender account is your testnet account so the client is already set-up to sign with your testnet account's private key to authorize the transfer.

```java
//Print the balance of tinybars
//fmt.Println("The account balance for the new account is ", accountBalance.Hbars.AsTinybar())
//-----------------------<enter code below>--------------------------------------

//Transfer hbar from your testnet account to the new account
transaction := hedera.NewTransferTransaction().
        AddHbarTransfer(myAccountId, hedera.HbarFrom(-1000, hedera.HbarUnits.Tinybar)).
        AddHbarTransfer(newAccountId,hedera.HbarFrom(1000, hedera.HbarUnits.Tinybar))

//Submit the transaction to a Hedera network
txResponse, err := transaction.Execute(client)

if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}

}

//Get the transaction consensus status
transactionStatus := transferReceipt.Status

fmt.Printf("The transaction consensus status is %v\n", transactionStatus)
```

**Step 3. Get the account balance**

**Get the cost of requesting the query**

You can request the cost of a query prior to submitting the query to the Hedera network. Checking an account balance is free of charge today. You can verify that by the method below.

```java
//Create the query that you want to submit
balanceQuery := hedera.NewAccountBalanceQuery().
     SetAccountID(newAccountId)

//Get the cost of the query
cost, err := balanceQuery.GetCost(client)

if err != nil {

println("The account balance query cost is:", cost.String())
```

**Get the account balance**

You will verify the account balance was updated for the new account by submitting a get account balance query. The current account balance should be the sum of the initial balance (1,000 tinybar) plus the transfer amount (1,000 tinybar) and equal to 2,000 tinybars.

//Sign with client operator private key and submit the query to a Hedera network
