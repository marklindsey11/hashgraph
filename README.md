# Hedera Hashgraph

## Hedera Hashgraph

Hedera is a public distributed ledger for building and deploying decentralized applications and microservices. You can use Hedera’s network services– Consensus, Tokens, Smart Contracts, and File Service–atop the [hashgraph consensus algorithm](core-concepts/hashgraph-consensus-algorithms/), to build applications with high throughput, fair ordering, and low-latency consensus finality in seconds without relying on centralized infrastructure.

The network is made up of permissioned nodes run by the the [Hedera Governing Council](https://hedera.com/council), a group of term-limited enterprises that lead the network's direction. Over time the network will [move to a permissionless model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTNNYeSks-s).

{% hint style="info" %}
Hedera Token Service is now live on our networks. Learn more in the blog series, [Get started with the Hedera Token Service](https://hedera.com/blog/get-started-with-the-hedera-token-service-part-1). Hedera Token Service API information can be found in the SDK section [here](docs/sdks/tokens/).

#### What is hashgraph?

Hashgraph is a distributed consensus algorithm and data structure that is fast, fair, and secure. This indirectly creates a trusted community, even when members do not necessarily trust each other. Hedera is the only authorized public network to use hashgraph. You can learn more about the consensus algorithm [here](core-concepts/hashgraph-consensus-algorithms/).

#### Under Development

The following features of the Hedera mainnet are still under development and therefore not yet available:

* State Proofs
  * An alpha version of the state proof is available [here](docs/mirror-node-api/cryptocurrency-api.md#state-proof-alpha)
* Live Hashes
* Staking

### Have Feedback?

We're actively working on expanding documentation, examples, and constantly improving our SDK. We'd love to hear from you if a particular subject is confusing, or you have suggestions for an improvement, please let us know by suggesting an [edit](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-docs) or in the [discord chat](https://hedera.com/discord).
