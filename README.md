# Hedera

## Hedera

Hedera is a distributed ledger for building and deploying decentralized applications and microservices. You can use Hedera’s network services– Consensus, Tokens, Smart Contracts, and File Service–atop the [hashgraph consensus algorithm](core-concepts/hashgraph-consensus-algorithms/), to build applications with high throughput, fair ordering, and low-latency consensus finality in seconds without relying on centralized infrastructure.

The network is made up of permissioned nodes run by the [Hedera Governing Council](https://hedera.com/council), a group of term-limited enterprises that lead the network's direction. Over time the network will [move to a permissionless model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTNNYeSks-s).

#### What is Hashgraph?

Hashgraph is a distributed consensus algorithm and data structure that is fast, fair, and secure. This indirectly creates a trusted community, even when members do not necessarily trust each other. Hedera is the only authorized public network to use hashgraph. You can learn more about the consensus algorithm [here](core-concepts/hashgraph-consensus-algorithms/).

#### Under Development

The following features of the Hedera mainnet are still under development and therefore not yet available:

* State Proofs
  * An alpha version of the state proof is available [here](docs/mirror-node-api/rest-api.md#state-proof-alpha)
* Live Hashes
* Staking
  * Phases I - IV for staking are found [here](https://docs.hedera.com/guides/core-concepts/staking)

### Have Feedback?

We're actively working on expanding documentation, examples, and constantly improving our SDK. We'd love to hear from you if a particular subject is confusing, or if you have suggestions for an improvement, please let us know by suggesting an [edit](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-docs) or in the [discord chat](https://hedera.com/discord).
