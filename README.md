# Hedera Hashgraph

## Hedera Hashgraph

Hedera is a public distributed ledger for building and deploying decentralized applications and microservices. You can use Hedera’s network services–Cryptocurrency, Smart Contracts, and File Service–atop the [hashgraph consensus algorithm](core-concepts/hashgraph-consensus-algorithms/), to build applications with high throughput, fair ordering, and low-latency consensus finality in seconds without relying on centralized infrastructure.

The network is made up of permissioned nodes run by the the [Hedera Governing Council](https://hedera.com/council), a group of term-limited enterprises that lead the network's direction. Over time the network will [move to a permissionless model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTNNYeSks-s).

#### What is hashgraph?

Hashgraph is a distributed consensus algorithm and data structure that is fast, fair, and secure. This indirectly creates a trusted community, even when members do not necessarily trust each other. Hedera is the only authorized public network to use hashgraph.

#### Under Development

The following features of the Hedera mainnet are still under development and therefore not yet available:

* State Proofs
* Live Hashes
* Staking
