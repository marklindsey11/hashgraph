# Delete a scheduled transaction

A transaction that deletes a scheduled transaction from the network. You can delete a scheduled transaction if only the admin key was set during the creation of the scheduled transaction. If an admin key was not set, the attempted deletion will result in "`SCHEDULE_IS_IMMUTABLE`" response from the network. Once the scheduled transaction is deleted, the scheduled transaction will be marked as deleted with the consensus timestamp the scheduled transaction was deleted at.

**Transaction Signing Requirements**

* The admin key of the scheduled transaction
