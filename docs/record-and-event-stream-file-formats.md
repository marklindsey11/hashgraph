# Record and Event Stream File Formats

## Overview&#x20;

The Hedera network produces record stream files and event stream files that captures chronological information about transactions that took place on the network. A record stream file is a file that contains a series of transactions in chronological order that occurred within a two second interval. The record stream file (.rcd) contains a transaction record for each transaction in that file. For each record stream file there is a corresponding signature file (rcd\_sig) that includes the signature generated by the node. The event stream file(.evts) contains information about an event. Event information includes event hash data, event unhashed data, and consensus data. Each event stream files are created in 5 second intervals. Each event stream file has a corresponding signature file (.evts\_sig) that includes the node signature. &#x20;

The record stream file and event stream file formats will both be updated to version 5 in a future mainnet release.&#x20;

**Note:** Current record signature files (rcd\_sig) and event signature (evts\_sig) file formats do not have a version number. The first byte's value is 4, which denotes a marker. For maintaining backwards compatibility, we made the first byte in the new version stream signature file be 5, which denotes the version. Thus, we use version 5 as the next version number.&#x20;

## Version 2 Record Stream File Format&#x20;

### Record Stream Files Names&#x20;

A record stream file name is made up of a string representation of the Instant of consensus timestamp of the first transaction in the file using ISO-8601 representation, with colons converted to underscores for Windows compatibility. The nano-of-second outputs zero, three, six or nine digits as necessary.&#x20;

Examples of a record stream file name with corresponding signature file:&#x20;

Record Stream File: 2020-10-19T21\_35\_39Z.rcd&#x20;

#### File Hash Calculation&#x20;

The record file hash is calculated using the following formula.&#x20;

**h\[i] = hash(p\[i-1] || h\[i-1] || hash(c\[i-1]))**&#x20;

* **||** denotes concatenation&#x20;
* **h\[i]** is the hash of the file i&#x20;
* **p\[i-1]** is the contents in the file before the PREV\_FILE\_HASH&#x20;
* **h\[i-1]** is the hash of file i-1, i.e., PREV\_FILE\_HASH&#x20;
* **c\[i-1]** is the contents of the file after PREV\_FILE\_HASH&#x20;

## Version 5 Record Stream File Format&#x20;

Generated using functionality provided by swirlds-common in the swirlds-platform sdk for serializing objects to record files (.rcd), and deserializing objects from record file (.rcd). In the next release, swirlds-common package will contain functionalities for parsing and verifying version 5 record stream files, which can be used by both services and mirror node. &#x20;

### Record Stream Files Names&#x20;

A record file name is created using a string representation of the Instant of consensus timestamp of the first transaction in the file using ISO-8601 representation, with colons converted to underscores for Windows compatibility. &#x20;

The nano-of-second always outputs nine digits with padding when necessary, to ensure same length filenames and proper sorting. &#x20;

Record File (.rcd): 2020-10-19T21\_35\_39.000000000Z.rcd&#x20;

In version 5 there are 3 different hashes being calculated:&#x20;

#### Object Running Hash&#x20;

* Object Running hash is calculated based on hash of each object, which allows us to remove contents of an object from a stream file while maintaining an unbroken chain of hashes. &#x20;
* The object running hash will be saved in state, so that reconnect nodes will be able to continue generating stream files identical to those generated by other nodes after reconnecting. &#x20;
* Object running hash is calculated as the following:\
  \
  `hash(Object Running Hash || hash(OBJECT))` \

  * || denotes concatenation&#x20;
  * In the event stream file OBJECT will be each event;&#x20;
  * In the record stream file OBJECT will be the Record Stream Object;&#x20;

#### Entire .rcd Hash&#x20;

* This hash is calculated on all the bytes of a .rcd file.&#x20;
* With the entire hash, mirror node can download valid .rcd files whose entire hash are agreed on by valid signatures of at least 1/3 of nodes.&#x20;
* Suppose the content of a .rcd file with version 5’s content is as following:\
  &#x20;\
  `f[i] = head[i] || startHash[i] || contents[i] || endHash[i]` \

  * || denotes concatenation
  * f\[i] denotes the whole content of a .rcd file;
  * head\[i] denotes the bytes before the start Object Running Hash;&#x20;
  * startHash\[i] denotes the Object Running Hash before writing this file;
  * contents\[i] denotes the content between the start Object Running Hash and the end    Object Running Hash;
  * endHash \[i] denotes the Object Running Hash before closing this file;
* Entire hash is calculated as following:&#x20;

&#x20;    `entireHash[i] = hash(head[i] || startHash[i] || contents[i] || endHash[i])`&#x20;

**Metadata .rcd Hash**&#x20;

* This hash is calculated on metadata bytes in the file, denoted in the table.&#x20;
* If some contents of an object were removed from a file, the metadata hash would still be valid.&#x20;
* Metadata hash is calculated as following:&#x20;

&#x20;  `metaHash[i] = hash(head[i] || startHash[i] || endHash[i])`   \


**Migration fo the record stream from v2 to v5**

`Hash Bytes` in `Start Object Running Hash` in the first v5 .rcd file is the same as `File Hash` in the last v2 .rcd\_sig file, which is also the hash of the last v2 .rcd file.

## Version 3 Event Stream File Format&#x20;

### Event Stream Files Names&#x20;

A string representation of the Instant of consensus timestamp of the first transaction in the file using ISO-8601 representation, with colons converted to underscores for Windows compatibility. The nano-of-second outputs zero, three, six or nine digits as necessary.&#x20;

Example of an event stream file name with corresponding signature file:&#x20;

Event Stream File (.evts): 2020-10-19T21\_35\_39.454265Z.evts&#x20;

Event Stream Signature File (.evts\_sig): 2020-10-19T21\_35\_39.454265Z.evts\_sig&#x20;

## Version 5 Event Stream File Format&#x20;

Generated using functionality provided by swirlds-common for serializing objects to .evts file, and deserializing objects from .evts file. In the next release, swirlds-common will contain functionalities for parsing and verifying version 5 event stream files, which can be used by both services and mirror node.&#x20;

### Event Stream Files Names&#x20;

A string representation of the Instant of consensus timestamp of the first transaction in the file using ISO-8601 representation, with colons converted to underscores for Windows compatibility. &#x20;

The nano-of-second always outputs nine digits with padding when necessary, to ensure same length filenames and proper sorting. &#x20;

### Event Stream Signature File Format (.evts\_sig)

In version 5, the event stream signature file format is the same as record stream signature file format. The below table describes the content that can be parsed from an event stream signature file. &#x20;
